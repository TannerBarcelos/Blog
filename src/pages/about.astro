    I am an experienced Full Stack Software Engineer with a deep passion for Web
    Development and Big Data. My primary goal is to bridge the gap between
    complex data and end users by creating interactive web experiences that make
    information accessible and engaging.

    Throughout my career, I have honed my skills in both front-end and back-end
    development, allowing me to tackle a wide range of projects and deliver
    comprehensive solutions. I thrive on the challenge of transforming intricate
    data sets into user-friendly interfaces that empower individuals to make
    informed decisions and gain valuable insights.

    In addition to my web development expertise, I have extensive experience
    working with SQL and data pipelines. I have worked on designing and
    optimizing relational databases, writing complex SQL queries to extract and
    manipulate data, and developing efficient data pipelines to process and
    transform large datasets. This experience has further fueled my interest in
    making data more accessible and engaging for users.

    My big data experience encompasses working with large-scale datasets,
    implementing distributed computing frameworks like Apache Spark, and
    leveraging technologies such as Hadoop and NoSQL databases to handle and
    analyze vast amounts of information. I have also worked on developing data
    visualization solutions to present complex data in intuitive and meaningful
    ways.

    Beyond my technical proficiency, I am a collaborative team player who values
    effective communication and enjoys working in dynamic environments. I thrive
    on constantly learning and staying up-to-date with the latest trends and
