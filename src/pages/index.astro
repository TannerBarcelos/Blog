      <h1>Hello and welcome to my blog!</h1>
      <p>
        I write about web development, software engineering, big data, and more.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer working at <a href='https://visa.com'
          >Visa</a
        >
        building Visa's next generation Data & AI Platform. I am passionate about
        Data and the Web. I am focused on bridging the gap between complex data and
        end users by creating interactive web experiences that make information accessible
        and engaging.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout my career, I have honed my skills in both front-end and
        back-end development, allowing me to tackle a wide range of projects and
        deliver comprehensive solutions. I thrive on the challenge of
        transforming intricate data sets into user-friendly interfaces that
        empower individuals to make informed decisions and gain valuable
        insights.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to my web development expertise, I have extensive experience
        working with SQL and data pipelines. I have worked on designing and
        optimizing relational databases, writing complex SQL queries to extract
        and manipulate data, and developing efficient data pipelines to process
        and transform large datasets. This experience has further fueled my
        interest in making data more accessible and engaging for users.
      </p>

      <p>
        My big data experience encompasses working with large-scale datasets,
        implementing distributed computing frameworks like Apache Spark, and
        leveraging technologies such as Hadoop and NoSQL databases to handle and
        analyze vast amounts of information. I have also worked on developing
        data visualization solutions to present complex data in intuitive and
        meaningful ways.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond my technical proficiency, I am a collaborative team player who
        values effective communication and enjoys working in dynamic
        environments. I thrive on constantly learning and staying up-to-date
        with the latest trends and advancements in the fields of web development
        and big data.
      </p>

      <p>
        I enjoy writing ✍🏼 and teaching 📚 all about Data. On my free time you
        will find me out on the golf course or camping ⛺️
