      <h1>Hello and welcome to my blog!</h1>
      <p>I write about the web, data, and other things I find interesting</p>
      <p>
        My name is Tanner and I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer working at Visa
        building Visa's next generation Data & AI Platform.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am an experienced Full Stack Software Engineer with a deep passion for
        Web Development. My primary goal is to bridge the gap between complex
        data and end users by creating interactive web experiences that make
        information accessible and engaging.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not only do I enjoy making data experiences better, but I am very
        passionate about productivity and I enjoy building applications that
        make life easier and more engaging.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout my career, I have honed my skills in both front-end and
        back-end development, allowing me to tackle a wide range of projects and
        deliver comprehensive solutions. I thrive on the challenge of
        transforming intricate data sets into user-friendly interfaces that
        empower individuals to make informed decisions and gain valuable
        insights.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond my technical proficiency, I am a collaborative team player who
        values effective communication and enjoys working in dynamic
        environments. I thrive on constantly learning and staying up-to-date
        with the latest trends and advancements in the fields of web development
        and big data.
      </p>

      <p>I enjoy writing ✍🏼 and teaching 📚 all about the web and data.</p>
