      <h1>Hello and welcome to my blog!</h1>
      <p>
        I write about web development, software engineering, big data, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        My name is Tanner and I am a Full Stack Software Engineer at <a
          href='https://visa.com/'>Visa</a
        >, specializing in building their next generation Data & AI Platform. My
        passion lies in creating interactive web experiences that make complex
        data accessible and engaging for end users.
      </p>

      <p>
        With expertise in both front-end and back-end development, I deliver
        comprehensive solutions that bridge the gap between intricate data and
        user-friendly interfaces. I thrive on transforming data sets into
        interfaces that empower individuals to make informed decisions and gain
        valuable insights.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to web development, I have experience in SQL and optimizing
        data pipelines. I excel in designing and optimizing relational
        databases, writing complex queries, and developing efficient data
        pipelines for processing and transforming large datasets.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have worked extensively with big data, utilizing distributed computing
        frameworks like Apache Spark and leveraging technologies such as Hadoop
        and NoSQL databases. I specialize in developing web based data
        visualization solutions that present complex information in intuitive
        and meaningful ways.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy writing and teaching about Data. You can often
        find me on the golf course or camping, indulging in outdoor activities.
